Modified version of the Irrlicht Engine SDK version 1.8.3 - Schwarzerlicht 
==========================================================================

  This engine has been modified by Andrea "Jens" Demetrio to fit the 
  development of Schwarzerblitz, and therefore must not be misrepresented 
  as a vanilla official version of Irrlicht. This release contains the headers,
  libraries and pre-compiled DLL needed to compile the Schwarzerblitz engine.
  The source code of the Scwharzerlicht version of the engine is available
  on request. Please, contact me at my email address 
  
  andrea.demetrio (at) hotmail.it 

  in case of need.
  Most of the engine is a 1-to-1 rehash of Irrlicht 1.8.3, with just a slight
  amount of patches and changes to add some minor missing functionality I
  needed during development. My changes can be considered "hack-y" (for
  which reason I haven't pushed them to the main Irrlicht repositories) but
  did their job.

 License
==========================================================================

  The license of the Irrlicht Engine is based on the zlib/libpng license.
  Even though this license does not require you to mention that you are
  using the Irrlicht Engine in your product, an acknowledgement
  would be highly appreciated.

  Please note that the Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of
  the Independent JPEG Group, the zlib, and libpng. This means that if you use
  the Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere
  in your documentation that you've used the IJG code and libpng. It would
  also be nice to mention that you use the Irrlicht Engine and the zlib.
  See the README files in the jpeglib and the zlib for
  further informations.
