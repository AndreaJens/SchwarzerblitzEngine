#profile
A glitch in the cyberspace who got animated and took the shape of a big question mark on a 3D floating cube. Random doesn't speak, doesn't eat, doesn't sleep. It is debatable if it is also not thinking, but since it shows an aggressive behavior against whoever approaches it, it is safe to assume that it has a sort of instinct.
Random is anyway an anomaly that could alter the fabric of reality itself. Direct contact must be avoided at all cost.
