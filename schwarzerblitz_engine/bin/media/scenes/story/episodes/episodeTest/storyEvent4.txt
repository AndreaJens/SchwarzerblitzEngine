Pretty sad for a pub.

(bartender) This is no pub, you blockhead! This is a night club with strippers and alcohol! Do you think that people come here to taste fine Irish whiskey?!

We've already met something like six times, Mr.~ "Trasimeno". I am called Johnson. You usally call me "blurry face", when you recognize me. Not so flattering, huh?
