We are near the Irish coast. In some ten minutes we will dock in a safe haven near the Dead Zone, Johnson. From there, you'll go wherever you need to. Just do not cross my road again, 'kay?

Crystal clear, Mr.~ Aural. But, alas, I will probably need your services one more time to leave the island.

I just want to ask you something, before we part ways: how did you best the lobster? You can be an excellent fighter, but with his carapace I find it hard that you managed to hurt him.

Speaking of which, I hope you'll survive the Haemophages, Johnson. There are few of them left, but hungry as hell. Try not to be their snack.
