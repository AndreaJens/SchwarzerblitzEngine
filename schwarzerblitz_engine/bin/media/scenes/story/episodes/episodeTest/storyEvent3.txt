Maybe, "accident" is not the right word. I believe that "deliberate massacre" is a more convincing one.

Pretty B-movie-ish, if you ask me, but who am I to judge? In any case, two million people died. And now, Northern Algol is something like a open-air graveyard. A bunch of lifeless ruins.

Some people used to travel there for making some cheap "found footage" movies. Heck, there was even a horror series a couple months ago. The truth is, Northern Algol is still dangerous. The damn flowers have never withered.

Except that the news said something about an unknown military robot being spotted there. Another thing which shouldn't surely be walking the dead streets of a deader city.

Reaching Ireland means ferry or airplane. Ferry or airplane mean identity card. And, technically, I don't have one, since I do not exist.
