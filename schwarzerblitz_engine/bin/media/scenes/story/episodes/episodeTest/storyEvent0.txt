A world where - as usual - I can walk without anyone caring about me.
Everyone is just randomly moving like a fly, following lights and neons without a precise path.

Sometimes I wonder... how did we come up to this point?
How comes people just mind their own business, without even taking a glance of what's happening around them?

Maybe I'm just brooding too much. Please, be free to gainsay my belief me at any time.
I just leave you a further question to help you formulate an answer.

That's right. Nobody can remember my face. Not even myself, while looking at the mirror. Everyone is seeing it as an indistinguishable mess of ever-changing fading... stuff.

Like a photograph completely out of focus. Only the eyes are where they are supposed to be. Except they don't look like eyes. Just less blurred areas on a blurred portrait.

It's like everyone - me included - is suffering from some sort of prosopagnosia, when looking at it. Feel free to browse some medical encyclopedia, I have enough spare time to wait for you to find what it is.

But, in any case, this doesn't matter. Nowadays, people don't give a damn about you. Except the usual random weirdo that starts insulting you without a reason...

Fortunately, there is a nice small ladder to reach the nearby riverside. It's actually used by the sanitation workers to store some wastes. Nobody in his right mind would go down there now.
