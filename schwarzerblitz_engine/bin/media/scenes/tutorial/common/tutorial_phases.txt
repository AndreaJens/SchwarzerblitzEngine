Welcome to this VR simulation! I'm Tutorial Man and I'm here to guide you through the game basics!
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
I've been built by putting together datasets from several fighters, so my moveset is precisely crafted for the task of showing you all the features you ought to know to play.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
During this tutorial you'll have to move a lot through the stage.
#MESSAGE_END

In case you lock yourself in some strange situation which prevents you from proceeding, press BACK (SELECT) on the joypad or BACKSPACE to reset the position of the characters.

Let's start with the basics, and - more specifically - with movement. You have to learn to manage space, if you want to win a match.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
You can freely move inside the arena by using UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT or any diagonal combination. These controls are mapped by the direction arrows by default, both on a joypad or on the keyboard.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Use LEFT or RIGHT to control the distance between you and your opponent, UP or DOWN to sidestep and flank him. Now, it's your turn: follow the HINTS displayed at the bottom of the screen and move your character!

#PHASE
#TYPE crouch
N 1000
#TYPE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
As you can freely move in the arena, you can also crouch and jump. These action require you to input a direction while you keep the GUARD button pressed. The GUARD button default is the D key for the keyboard and the A button on a joypad.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
In order to crouch, you have to press the DOWN button while the GUARD button is pressed. You can stop pressing GUARD when you have crouched and you remain in the stance as long as you keep DOWN pressed.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
In order to jump, press either UP, UP + RIGHT, or UP + LEFT while you keep GUARD pressed. You can release the GUARD button when the jump starts.
#MESSAGE_END

#TYPE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Sometimes, instead of rushing against the enemy, you could need to quickly retreat. One way to do this is the so-called BACKDASH.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
The BACKDASH is a universal move which is available to all characters. You can perform it by quickly tapping LEFT two times (mirror as usual when on right side).
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
During the starting frames of a backdash, you are invincible. This means that you can use it to avoid some really damaging attacks, if you time it right!

Sometimes, instead, you need to rush fast. And when I mean fast, I mean REALLY fast. In that case, you just have to press RIGHT two times and keep RIGHT pressed (mirror the input if you are on the other side).
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Doing so, you will start running towards your opponent. Now, move far away from them and rush!

#MESSAGE_END

You can check the available combinations at any time in the Pause Menu (default: ESC key / START button).
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Now, let's start with punches! Hit your opponent with all the punch-based attack shown in the HINTS! The default PUNCH button is W key on a keyboard / Y button on a joypad.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
If you see a direction in the input, remember that you have to press the direction and then the PUNCH button while the direction is kept pressed. LEFT and RIGHT have to be mirrored, if you switch side with the opponent.

Before focusing on the defense, let's spend a couple words on CHAIN. Most of the attacks can be chained together, forming a CHAIN. A CHAIN is not guaranteed to hit with all the moves, but can be used to apply pressure on the opponent.

It seems you are mastering attack... but what about defense?
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
As you may remember, by keeping GUARD pressed you can defend yourself from your opponent's assault.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
A standing guard (i.e. only GUARD pressed) will protect you against HIGH and MID attack, while a crouching GUARD (DOWN + GUARD) will protect you from LOW attacks.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Notice that a MID attack will crush your crouching guard, no matter what.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Now, use what you learned to guard all of your opponent attacks! Remember to shift your guard from standing to crouching when the opponent delivers a low attack, and vice versa!

Moreover, throws can be escaped by pressing an input just after being caught by one. The default input is TECH, but certain throws have different escape inputs - and certain have none at all.
#MESSAGE_END

As a concrete example, Evilobster's command throws have to be guarded like a normal attack.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Now, what about trying to escape a throw? Wait for the opponent to start the attack, then press TECH while he's grabbing you. If the camera angle changes, is already too late!

As an additional hint, try to press the button as soon as you hear the "swing" noise when the opponent starts moving.

As an additional note, if you press the TECH button right before hitting the ground - after being hit by an opponent attack, you will perform a Recovery Ukemi.

#TYPE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
You can win the match in basically three ways: either you deplete your opponent energy, you have more energy when the timer ends, or you send him flying out of the ring.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
The first two are quite straightforward, so we will focus on the third one. In order to perform a ring out, you have to hit the opponent with an IMPACT ATTACK while he's near the border of the arena.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
An Impact Attack is a usually slow move which sends the opponent flying if it connects. An example is your "Version Update", a slow, high-damaging roundhouse kick, as well as both your running attacks.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Not all the stages allows for a ring out. For example, until now this stage was protected by invisible walls... that I've conveniently deactivated.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
That's it. Now, send your opponent flying!

Okay, time to start the last part of the class! We will talk about TRIGGERS.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Triggers are one of the most important mechanics to master in Schwarzerblitz. Your success at high difficulties will heavily depend on their good or bad use.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Have a look at the corner, below your health bar. You will see that a small green BULLET COUNTER has appeared. To use a Trigger, you have to spend a bullet counter.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Triggers can be used to make an attack more powerful. A Triggered move will break the opponent guard and inflict more damage. Moreover, it will slow down time, allowing you to input combo in a easier way, and increase the opponent hitstun.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
This means, that you can use a trigger to transform a CHAIN in a proper COMBO. The Trigger Mode stays active until you miss an attack or you stop the chain.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
To perform a Trigger attack, you have first to READY a Bullet Counter. Do this by pressing the TRIGGER BUTTON. By default, this is E on a keyboard and RIGHT BUMPER on a joypad. One of the Bullet counters will then start flashing RED.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
If you then input the attack while the TRIGGER BUTTON is kept pressed, the attack will become a Trigger Attack and you will hear a loud gunshot. After the first Trigger Attack, you can release the TRIGGER BUTTON.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
I've spent enough words on it. Try it out!

Basically, Triggers can also be used in a defensive fashion. While you are hit, you can use a Bullet counter to exit hitstun and retaliate. This action is called TRIGGER GUARD.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
To activate a TRIGGER GUARD, you must press together TRIGGER + GUARD right after the opponent successfully hit you.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
If you time it correctly, the following attack will be parried - provided it is in a short time window since the buttons are pressed.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
If the opponent is attacking with a Trigger Attack, he will suffer an Impact and will be sent away flying. You must keep the buttons pressed, otherwise you will be vulnerable to a followup.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Now, this will require a bit of timing and reflexes, so do not despair if you can't do it at once!
