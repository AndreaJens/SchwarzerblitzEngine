Welcome to this VR simulation! I'm Tutorial Man and I'm here to guide you through the game basics!

During this tutorial you'll have to move a lot through the stage. In case you lock yourself in some strange situation which prevents you from proceeding, press BACK (SELECT) on the joypad or BACKSPACE to reset the position of the characters.

Let's start with the basics, and - more specifically - with movement. By using the DIRECTION ARROWS on either the keyboard or a joypad, you can freely move on the stage.

As you can freely move in the arena, you can also CROUCH and JUMP. These action require you to input a direction while you keep the GUARD button pressed. The GUARD button default is the D key for the keyboard and the A button on a joypad.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
In order to crouch, you have to press the DOWN button while the GUARD button is pressed. If you let go of GUARD while pressing DOWN, your character will remain crouched.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
In order to jump, press either UP, UP + RIGHT, or UP + LEFT while you keep GUARD pressed. You can release the GUARD button when the jump starts.

#TYPE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Sometimes, instead of rushing against the enemy, you could need to quickly retreat. One way to do this is the so-called BACKDASH.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
The BACKDASH is a universal move which is available to all characters. You can perform it by quickly tapping LEFT two times (mirror as usual when on right side).
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
During the starting frames of a backdash, you are invincible. This means that you can use it to avoid some really damaging attacks, if you time it right!

Backdash 3 times

You could be tempted by the idea of trying to move that fast also in the third dimension, right? Well, the good news is that YOU CAN.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
The SIDEDASH is another universal move which is available to all characters. You can perform it by quickly tapping UP or DOWN two times, depending of the direction you want to move towards.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Contrary to the BACKDASH, though, it doesn't grant any invincibiltiy against low attacks, so be careful while using it.

#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Sometimes, instead, you need to rush fast. And when I mean fast, I mean REALLY fast. In that case, you just have to press RIGHT two times and keep RIGHT pressed (mirror the input if you are on the other side).
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Doing so, you will start running towards your opponent. Now, move far away from them and rush!
#MESSAGE_END

Run towards your opponent
