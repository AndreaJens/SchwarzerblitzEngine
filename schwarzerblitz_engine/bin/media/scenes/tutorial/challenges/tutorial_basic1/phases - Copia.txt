Welcome to this VR simulation! I'm Tutorial Man and I'm here to guide you through the game basics!
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
I've been built by putting together datasets from several fighters, so my moveset is precisely crafted for the task of showing you all the features you ought to know to play.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
During this tutorial you'll have to move a lot through the stage.

In case you lock yourself in some strange situation which prevents you from proceeding, press BACK (SELECT) on the joypad or BACKSPACE to reset the position of the characters.

Let's start with the basics, and - more specifically - with movement. You have to learn to manage space, if you want to win a match.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
You can freely move inside the arena by using UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT or any diagonal combination. These controls are mapped by the direction arrows by default, both on a joypad or on the keyboard.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Use LEFT or RIGHT to control the distance between you and your opponent, UP or DOWN to sidestep and flank him. Now, it's your turn: follow the HINTS displayed at the bottom of the screen and move your character!

It looks like you are learning fast. It's time to move on to the remaining basic stances.

#TYPE crouch
N 1000
#TYPE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
As you can freely move in the arena, you can also crouch and jump. These action require you to input a direction while you keep the GUARD button pressed. The GUARD button default is the D key for the keyboard and the A button on a joypad.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
In order to crouch, you have to press the DOWN button while the GUARD button is pressed. You can stop pressing GUARD when you have crouched and you remain in the stance as long as you keep DOWN pressed.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
In order to jump, press either UP, UP + RIGHT, or UP + LEFT while you keep GUARD pressed. You can release the GUARD button when the jump starts.
#MESSAGE_END

Now, follow the hints and try it out!

#TYPE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Sometimes, instead of rushing against the enemy, you could need to quickly retreat. One way to do this is the so-called BACKDASH.
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
The BACKDASH is a universal move which is available to all characters. You can perform it by quickly tapping LEFT two times (mirror as usual when on right side).
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
During the starting frames of a backdash, you are invincible. This means that you can use it to avoid some really damaging attacks, if you time it right!
#MESSAGE_END
#HINT
Backdash 3 times

#TYPE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Sometimes, instead, you need to rush fast. And when I mean fast, I mean REALLY fast. In that case, you just have to press RIGHT two times and keep RIGHT pressed (mirror the input if you are on the other side).
#MESSAGE_END
#MESSAGE_BEGIN
Doing so, you will start running towards your opponent. Now, move far away from them and rush!
#MESSAGE_END
#HINT
Run towards your opponent, starting from afar
